    <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
    <p>This is a spiral mac and cheese recipe my family has been using for a long time. I'm not sure where it originated from, but we definitely enjoy every bite!</p>

    <h1>Ingredient</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fusilli (spiral) pasta</li>
        <li>¼ cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced onion</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>4 ounces processed cheese food</li>
        <li>¼ cup blue cheese crumbles</li>
        <li>¼ cup cubed Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dry mustard</li>

    
        <h1>Directions</h1>
        <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in fusilli and return to a boil. Cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink.</p>
        
        <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.</p>

        <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Whisk in flour and cook for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in milk until entirely incorporated.</p>

        <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <p>Add cheese food, blue cheese, Cheddar, salt, pepper, and mustard; cook and stir continually until cheeses have melted and mixture is thick. Fold in pasta until coated, then pour mixture into the prepared casserole dish.</p>

        <h1>Step 5</h1>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the top begins to brown, about 20 minutes.</p>
    </ul>
